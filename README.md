# random-selector
Short Python 3 script which selects a random name from a list of presenters in a CSV, using the sample function from Pandas. 
###
Only selects from students where _Presented_ = no.

Originally created to randomly pick a student to present in one of my classes!! Sure, this could be done in a number of other, simpler, more boring ways, but why not write a short script instead??
